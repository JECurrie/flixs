I built a movie review app.
I stored everything in a database and list all the events on the front page.
You can see current movies or only upcoming movies.
Each movie will have its own detail page with additional information about the event.
You will need to sign in first, then you can write a review.
Under your account, you can see what movies.
Only users who have admin privileges, can add new movies or edit existing movies.
